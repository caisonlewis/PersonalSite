I don't really have any friends I can talk to about this stuff, so I figured this could be my outlet. Plus, I get some coding experience in the process. It's kinda fun so far—this is only day one.

The old-gen page needs updated tables for my actual teams; I've only done Pokémon Blue and LeafGreen so far. The others have placeholder mons in them. \nI have also added my much-anticipated backlog, importing it from Google Sheets so it should maintain live updates. I want to try to actually play and beat one game at a time. Other than that, I'm currently working on pushing out some CSS changes that allow for everything to stay centered and look nice on any screen size. More to come. Peace! :)"

    "I'm back! Had a lot going on the last few weeks. Time for a little recap. Had a couple interviews for jobs in the tech field (FINALLY) but there are a couple caveats.\n First, there was one job that would have been an IT leadership role working with data for a concessions company. I got the interview because of a banger cover letter, but the guy was fairly unimpressed with my resume. I was kinda mid in the interview but wrote back a really good follow up email that detailed how I would stay with the company for a while and even work for a decreased salary because of my lack of professional experience. They emailed me back a week later with for a follow up interview. They had to reschedule it with me, then eventually just decided to not move forward. Bummer.\n The second is a field tech job with Toshiba. I got a recommendation from a guy who I met through my job now, that already works for them. First was a phone interview with their recruiter based in Durham or something.. went super well, she liked me a lot. Next was with the actual manager lady for the location I would be working at. Also went well, she was impressed with me. Finally, yesterday I had the final interview with one of their lead techs. The guy was asking me a bunch of hardware related questions, trying to get a feel for my technical knowledge. This did not go as well... I'm a software guy, not a hardware guy. Not really into hardware as much, nor am I great at it. Still haven't heard anything back about the job since that interview. I'm gonna be real though.. I'm having second thoughts about even taking it if they offer it to me.\n First, it's hardware service and troubleshooting, not really what I'm into. Second, I don't think the pay is that great.. and third, they give you a company vehicle because there is a lot of travel involved. Not sure if I'm down for all the travel or being on call on the weekends but also I'm not 100% sure I would pass the driving record check. Let's just say I did some dumb shit as a 19-20yo kid and it's like permanently stained my driving record. So yeah.. not sure what I'm gonna do yet. I really don't hate what I'm doing now, I kinda just want to stay at Walgreens for the time being and wait for a coding job. That's what I REALLY want to do.. \nAnyway, I've been really getting into playing my retro emulation handheld lately. I have an Anbernic RG35XX Plus. I love the thing man. I downloaded a Linux based OS on it (Knulli..it's a branch of Batocera which uses an emulation station frontend) and I really like all the customization settings. I don't love that I can't exactly tweak EVERYTHING through retroarch.. the retroarch config is all done through the Knulli frontend. But, I've found some work arounds to get the shaders and bezels and stuff that I like for specific systems. Been trying to finish up the elite 4 in Leafgreen, been playing old school Dragon Quest on NES, little bit of Final Fantasy IV, and even got portmaster working. I can play Balatro and Stardew Valley on the thing. It's pretty sick. Anyway... sorry for the long winded update. Talk soon ✌️"

"Still doing the same stuff. Working, playing video games, sleeping, and repeating that over and over and over again. Sounds fun right? So I've figured out that I am not going to get a programming job..like ever. I'm actually kinda happy that I don't have to stress about it anymore but at the end of the day, it kinda sucks. So, I am an idiot who didn't realize that I was pursuing a career in the most saturated job market in the country. You cannot get into it with no experience, rendering my degree pretty much worthless and even if you do have experience (somehow?! maybe internship or something) you are still competing against other MORE experienced people who have been laid off from big tech companies and are now in the available job market again. 99.9% of job application I have spent time on submitting, along with tweaking my resume regularly and writing cover letters, do not get viewed at all. For someone like me who has no professional experience in software and only the degree. Applying for software jobs (even entry level/Junior dev) is a complete waste of time. You will not be even considered. Sooo what does this mean? Well, I can keep doing what I am doing now for the foreseeable future (which is making barely any money and living in a perpetual cycle of doing shit I don't want to do and hiding the internal suffering with escapism through video games) or I can apply for other stuff that isn't software.IT related but something I may have a shot of at least getting an interview for because I have a bachelors degree. Is it possible to find something like this that I could somewhat tolerate and it pays more than I am making now? Possibly. Am I putting forward a considerable effort to attain such a thing? Absolutely not :) So yeah. Happy almost summer and almost six months of this shit :D ")

const june_13_25 = new JournalEntry("Recent Hyper-Fixations", "6/13/2025", "Recently after finishing Dragon Quest XI, I have been really into Dragon Quest as a whole. I bought DQIII HD 2D remake and started playing through it and it's gorgeous. Looking forward to finishing it and then playing 1 and 2 to complete the whole Erdrick story. I have also been back on an Animal Crossing kick, specifically Wild World and New Leaf. These games are wholesome nostalgia comfort food and I can't get enough of it. I bought No Mans Sky on PS5 also. I have about 100 hours and beat the game on PC and have another 20-30 hours on Switch. Such an addictive space survival/exploration game and it is absolutely gorgeous on PS5. Anyway... maybe I'll had some more stuff to this site.. maybe not.. who knows.")

const july_13_25 = new JournalEntry("Coming Soon", "7/13/2025", "well, it's been a month, still pretty much doing the same thing I was doing a month ago, kinda been in a better place mentally I guess. Not great but not worse.. Back to the reason for this post; I am putting up a new page soon to document my new undertaking. I am working on a professor oaks challenge on Pokemon Black 2. It is going to be a massive undertaking but I really want to see if I can do it and I think it will be really fun to train up Pokemon I have never really used before on a standard playthrough team. Look forward to the new page and (somewhat) regular updates on the challenge. I'll detail the rules and all that good stuff on this page as well. I'll probably have it set up after I complete the first badge or 'section' of the run (which by the way, is a large undertaking it itself, Black 2 and White 2 are notoriouslly hard in general for a POC but the first section is especially brutal) Until then, peace ✌️");

const oct_23_25 = new JournalEntry("It's been a while AGAIN..", "10/23/2025","Like normal, I'm posting for the first time in forever. This time it's been like 3 months! Time is flying by and not a lot has changed. Still pretty much doing the same thing I was back in July as far as work and home life. My Black 2 professor Oaks challenge is a bust. Put a lot of time into getting the first section done and my retroid pocket crapped out on me and I lost the save. Needless to say I am not redoing the hours of grinding I lost. However, I did start a new POC for Pokémon Ruby on cartridge and I've made it decently far into the first section since August. Doing a POC for ruby has made me realize just how much of an undertaking Black 2 would have been. Ruby is miles easier and more enjoyable. I've had it on pause for a bit but plan to get back to it soon. Got legends ZA on release last week. Plan on finish up my playthrough of it and giving my thoughts on my completed games page at some point soon. I would love to get back into putting more into this site or even restructuring my horrible code for it so it is somewhat presentable. We will see.. Until next time! ✌️ ");
